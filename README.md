**BeReal meets Partiful meets theNudge.**

**Premise:** All users sign up to participate in randomly generated events organized by area, price, and activity type. These events can be generated on a daily, weekly, or monthly cadence. Events are niche, quirky, and customizable to user preference.

**User Experience:**
1. Users are able to sign up for 2 group types:
   - As an individual to meet other individuals
   - As a group meeting other groups.
2. Users are able to set preferences for:
   - Price Point
   - Activity Type (Physical vs. Mental)
   - Duration
   - Distance from user, capped at 100 miles
3. Events are suggested the morning of the event. A timer countdown is present to the reveal of the event.
   - Location
   - Activity
   - Photo dump area
   - Event rating + feedback area
4. Users are able to see who is going to attend, like a Partiful list.
5. User profiles are enabled. Able to see:
   - Friends
   - Previous events attended
   - Preferences
   - Rating System (friendliness, safety, etc)
   - Badges
6. Report Button
   - Users are able to give feedback on each attendee anonymously.
   - Users unaware of reports given on them, only fed directly to app for matchmaking and potential ban purposes

**Business:**
1. Get the application off the ground and obtain as large a user base as possible in the targeted launch area.
2. Reach a certain threshold (3 concurrent events) and begin fielding local businesses to sponsor or host events for free.
3. Introduce an Ad-based unlock for the daily event for ad-revenue
4. Host a HereNow convention with organizations or businesses that have hosted, low entry cost.
5. Reach another threshold to start having businesses bid for events.
